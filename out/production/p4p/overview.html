Peers for Privacy (P4P) is a collection of tools and classes supporting 
the P4P private distributed computation framework in Java. Packages in 
P4P include,

<ul>
<li> A number of cryptographic primitives including commitment schemes 
     and their zero-knowledge proofs. (odis.crypto)
<li> simulation samples for the P4P computation. (p4p.sim)
<li> implements the ZKP that the user vector's L2-norm is bounded by a 
     constant L. Used to restrict the influence a malicious user
     could have on the computation (p4p.user.UserVector2).
<li> Other nits and bits. (p4p.util).
</ul>
 
P4P uses the native big integer lib from <a href="http://www.i2p.net/">I2P</a>
